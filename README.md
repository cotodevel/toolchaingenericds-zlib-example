NTR/TWL SDK: TGDS1.65

master: Development branch. Use TGDS1.65: branch for stable features.

This is the ToolchainGenericDS Woopsi ZLIB Compression project:

1.	Compile Toolchain:
To compile this project you will need to follow the steps at https://bitbucket.org/Coto88/toolchaingenericds :
Then simply extract the project somewhere.

2.	Compile this project: 
Open msys, through msys commands head to the directory your extracted this project.
Then write:
make clean <enter>
make <enter>

After compiling, run the example in NDS. 

Project Specific description:
A Woopsi UI + TGDS SDK template for UI control handling on the NintendoDS. 
Draw the pop up windows across the screen or scroll other windows to test touchscreen. 
Also plays WAV/AD-PCM (Intel) files from the directory!

- Also allows to decompress multiple files within a .ZIP of any size. 
  May be slower on slower ASIC slot-1 cards or if the DLDI driver is unoptimized.

Note: UI Controls experimental.


____Remoteboot____
Also, it's recommended to use the remoteboot feature. It allows to send the current TGDS Project over wifi removing the necessity
to take out the SD card repeteadly and thus, causing it to wear out and to break the SD slot of your unit.

Usage:
- Make sure the wifi settings in the NintendoDS are properly set up, so you're already able to connect to internet from it.

- Get a copy of ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot: https://bitbucket.org/Coto88/ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot/get/TGDS1.65.zip
Follow the instructions there and get either the TWL or NTR version. Make sure you update the computer IP address used to build TGDS Projects, 
in the file: toolchaingenericds-multiboot-config.txt of said repository before moving it into SD card.

For example if you're running NTR mode (say, a DS Lite), you'll need ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot.nds, tgds_multiboot_payload_ntr.bin
and toolchaingenericds-multiboot-config.txt (update here, the computer's IP you use to build TGDS Projects) then move all of them to root SD card directory.

- Build the TGDS Project as you'd normally would, and run these commands from the shell.
<make clean>
<make>

- Then if you're on NTR mode:
<remoteboot ntr_mode computer_ip_address>

- Or if you're on TWL mode:
<remoteboot twl_mode computer_ip_address>

- And finally boot ToolchainGenericDS-multiboot, and press (X), wait a few seconds and TGDS Project should boot remotely.
  After that, everytime you want to remoteboot a TGDS Project, repeat the last 2 steps. ;-)
